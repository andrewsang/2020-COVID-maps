# 2020 COVID-19 maps
During the first year of the pandemic, as much was yet unknown, the full extent of the pandemic had yet to be ralized. With that behind us now, we can have a broad overview of the outcomes that the pandemic has ushered. This project visualizes COVID rates, counts, and deaths by both the state and county level.
